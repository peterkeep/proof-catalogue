# Introductory Calculus Proof Catalogue
This is a catalogue of proofs of results in introductory calculus. The goal is to be able to present different versions of the proofs of these results depending on what is appropriate, or what the goals of the instructor are.

## Structure

The catalogue is broken into six categories:

1. Pre-Calculus Results
2. Limit Results
3. Derivative Rules
4. Results using Derivatives
5. Integration Rules
6. Sequences and Series

These six span most of a typical first year calculus curriculum, with some topics omitted because of a lack of proofs in the typical presentation.

**Note:** More topics might be added with a loosening of the idea of "proof."

## Indexing Proofs

Proofs will be presented, but more importantly indexed based on common characteristics and pre-requisite knowledge. Each proof will contain some basic background information when available.
